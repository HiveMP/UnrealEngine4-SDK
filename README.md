HiveMP SDK for Unreal Engine 4
=======================================

This is the integrated HiveMP SDK for Unreal Engine 4.

This SDK makes all of Hive's APIs available as blueprints in Unreal Engine 4.

## Installation

Clone this repository into `Plugins\OnlineSubsystemHive` in your Unreal Engine project such that `Plugins\OnlineSubsystemHive\OnlineSubsystemHive.uplugin` exists.

If you are using Git, you can install this as a submodule with:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/HiveMP/UnrealEngine4-SDK
 Plugins/OnlineSubsystemHive
```

When you next open your project via the Unreal launcher, it may tell you it's out of date and needs to be rebuilt; you should say Yes to rebuild the project.

## Documentation

Please refer to the [online Hive documentation](https://docs.hivemp.com) website for information on how to install and use this SDK.
