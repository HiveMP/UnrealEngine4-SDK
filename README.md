HiveMP SDK for Unreal Engine 4
=======================================

This is the integrated HiveMP SDK for Unreal Engine 4.

This SDK makes all of Hive's APIs available as blueprints in Unreal Engine 4.

## Installation

Download the latest release from https://github.com/HiveMP/UnrealEngine4-SDK/releases/tag/latest for the version of Unreal Engine 4 that you are using in your project.

Extract the ZIP file somewhere and place the `OnlineSubsystemHive` folder underneath the `Plugins` folder in your project. You may need to create it if it doesn't exist.

When everything is setup, the file `<yourproject>\Plugins\OnlineSubsystemHive\OnlineSubsystemHive.uplugin` should exist. You can then open your project from the Epic Games launcher.

## Documentation

Please refer to the [online Hive documentation](https://docs.hivemp.com) website for information on how to install and use this SDK.
